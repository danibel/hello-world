# hello-world
my first repository!

I am learning GIT so that I can get a job as a web designer/developer. I know HTML5 and CSS very well. I am working on hand building responsive sites. My background is in sales of security software, and I would like to utilize my sales skills in my new career. I have writing and marketing skills, as well as social media management chops.

Hire me!
